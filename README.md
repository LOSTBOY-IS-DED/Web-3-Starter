# ðŸš€ Getting Started with Solana Web3.js & SPL Tokens

Welcome to your **Solana blockchain starter kit!** ðŸŽ‰

If youâ€™re new to blockchain development, youâ€™ve probably heard how powerful and fast Solana is, and how the [solana-web3.js](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js) and [SPL Token](https://spl.solana.com/token) libraries make interacting with the blockchain seamless and fun.

---

## Why Solana?

- **Blazing fast** transactions with sub-second finality  
- Extremely **low fees** compared to other chains  
- Growing ecosystem with tons of **DeFi, NFTs, and dApps**

---

## Whatâ€™s in this repo?

This project provides simple, clear examples showing how to:

- Connect to the Solana blockchain (Devnet, Testnet, or your local test validator)  
- Generate and manage wallets (Keypairs)  
- Request SOL airdrops for testing  
- Send SOL transactions between wallets  
- Check wallet balances  
- Get you comfortable with the essential Solana SDK functions

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v16+ installed  
- Basic TypeScript/JavaScript knowledge  
- Some familiarity with blockchain concepts (optional, but helpful)

---

## How to use

1. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pnpm add @solana/web3.js
```
___

## Run your code:

Use the sample scripts in this repo to interact with Solana â€” for example, sending SOL between wallets or checking balances.

---

## Explore and experiment!

Try modifying the scripts to:

Send SPL tokens instead of SOL

Connect to different clusters (devnet, testnet, or your local validator)

Build your own wallet UI

## NOTE 

adding SPL token to another repo will attach it later
